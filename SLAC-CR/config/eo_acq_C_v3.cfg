# Fe55
# Fe55 x-ray exposures are acquired in sets of a given exposure time and
# image count. Bias images are acquired prior to acquiring any fe55 images.
# The number of bias frames is set by FE55_BCOUNT
# For each command, dark images of the appropriate integration time are
# also acquired. The number of dark frames is set by FE55_DCOUNT.
#
FE55_BCOUNT     5     # number of bias frames per complete fe55 set
FE55_DCOUNT     0     # number of dark frames per fe55 'command'
fe55    300.0   5     # exposure time and image count for an fe55 data set

###############################################################################
# Dark
# Dark integration images are acquired in sets of a given exposure time and
# image count. Bias images are acquired prior to acquiring any dark images
#
# A constant named DARK_BCOUNT is used to specifiy the number of bias images
# to acquire as part of the data set prior to acquiring the dark images.
#
# NOTE: ANALYSIS REQUIRES EXPTIME TO BE EQUAL
DARK_BCOUNT    5    # number of bias frames per dark set

dark   300.0   5    # integration time and image count for dark set

# superflat
# 'superflat' images are sets of identical flat field exposures that can
# be medianed together to produce a flat field image with reduced variation
# due to poisson statistics. They are useful in calculating CTE and PRNU and
# for finding dark defects.
#
# A constant named SFLAT_BCOUNT is used to specifiy the number of bias images
# to acquire as part of the data set prior to acquiring the flat field images.
#
# NOTE: ANALYSIS REQUIRES SOME TAKEN AT 500nm
SFLAT_BCOUNT   0    # number of bias frames to take with a superflat set
SFLAT_HILIM   200.0  # maximum seconds for a superflat exposure
SFLAT_LOLIM     0.1  # minimum seconds for a superflat exposure

# Lambda
# Acquire images for use in QE measurement.
# Images are acquired as 'sets' of images that include a bias frame and
# N exposures of a given duration at a specified wavelength.
# The lambda 'command' has the format of:
#
# lambda   wavelength  signal
# where signal is desired image signal in e-/pixel
#
LAMBDA_IMCOUNT   1    # number of images at each wavelength
LAMBDA_BCOUNT    5    # total number of bias frames

# Flat
# Acquire flat image pairs for linearity and gain measurement.
